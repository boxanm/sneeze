However, they are susceptible to failure when a robot sustains extreme velocities and accelerations. For example, this kind of motion can happen after a collision, causing a point cloud to be heavily skewed. While point cloud de-skewing methods have been explored in the past to increase localization and mapping accuracy, these methods still rely on highly accurate odometry systems or ideal navigation conditions. In this paper, we present a method taking into account the remaining motion uncertainties of the trajectory used to de-skew a point cloud along with the environment geometry to increase the robustness of current registration algorithms. We compare our method to three other solutions in a test bench producing 3D maps with peak accelerations of 200 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 800 rad/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In these extreme scenarios, we demonstrate that our method decreases the error by 9.26 % in translation and by 21.84 % in rotation. The proposed method is generic enough to be integrated to many variants of weighted ICP without adaptation and supports localization robustness in harsher terrains.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;A novel motion uncertainty-based point weighting model, allowing the robustness of registration algorithms to be improved when subject to high velocities and accelerations, requiring neither high-fidelity pose estimation nor prior knowledge of the environment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experimental comparison of our proposed approach with state-of-the-art approaches on a dataset gathered at high velocities and accelerations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A highlight of the impact of point cloud skewing on the accuracy of localization and mapping.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top figure shows the experimental platform used for this work. A lidar and an IMU are mounted on a sensing platform, which is protected by a cage. A rope is attached to the platform and pulled on by an operator to induce high velocities and accelerations during lidar scans. Using this platform, we acquired scans at linear speeds and accelerations up to 3.5 m/s and 200 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and angular speeds and accelerations up to 11 rad/s and 800 rad/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in an indoor garage. When an operator pulled the rope, we recorded scans with our platform and used our method to build a map of the environment and localize within it. No prior knowledge of the environment is required by our method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom figure shows a top view of three 3D reconstructions of the environment built while applying peak accelerations up to 194.98 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on our sensing platform. All three maps were built using the same data, with our method only used for the rightmost map. Points in dark purple have high error and points in green have low error. The error was computed against a ground truth map built while moving slowly the sensors. De-skewing significantly impacts the mean error by reducing it from 21.95 cm to 7.27 cm. Further improvement is gained by using our method, leading to a mean error of 6.86 cm. For example, one can observe an improvement in accuracy on the left wall.&lt;/p&gt;

the development of mapping and localization algorithms through
creation of cornerstone datasets. In outdoor environments and
over long distance, total stations are the most accurate and precise
measurement instruments for this purpose. Most total station-
based systems in the literature are limited to three Degrees Of
Freedoms (DOFs), due to the use of a single-prism tracking ap-
proach. In this paper, we present preliminary work on measuring
a full pose of a vehicle, bringing the referencing system to six
DOFs. Three total stations are used to track in real time three
prisms attached to a target platform. We describe the structure
of the referencing system and the protocol for acquiring the
ground truth with it. We evaluated its precision in a variety of
different outdoor environments, ranging from open-sky to forest
trails, and compare it with another popular source of reference
position, the Real Time Kinematics (RTK) positioning solution.
Results show that our approach is the most precise one, reaching
an average positional error of 10 mm and 0.6 deg. This difference
in performance was particularly stark in environments where
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals can be weaker
due to overreaching vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;contributions&quot;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A tracking system using multiple total stations to obtain the 6DOFs of a mobile robot in outdoor environment;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A calibration procedure of multiple total stations for a
vehicle continuous tracking;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A time synchronization and a long-range data transmis-
sion protocol for online pose referencing;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A precision analysis of our tracking procedure; and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A comparison against a RTK positioning system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results-in-images&quot;&gt;Results in Images&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ground the performance of the total station referencing
system to a commonly-known alternative, we compared it to
the RTK solution. 
The satellite localization performed well in open areas, but a
decreased in accuracy can be observed when portions of the sky
view were obstructed by vegetation. 
To this effect, we have recorded the RTK positioning data during two experiments: one in the quarry and another one in the forest. 
Similarly to using the inter-prism distance to estimate the
total station localization precision, we rely on the measured
distance between the GNSS receivers to estimate their precision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the top figure, we compare the precision of the corrected
RTK localization and our total station referencing system in the quarry. In this environment and with the robot moving, the precision is equivalent as shown on the histogram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a more difficult scenario, the bottom figure shows portions of the forest experiment, where the robot was in reach of all three total stations. 
From the beginning until the mark of 200 s and in the reminder of the experiment (right plot), the GNSS signals are significantly attenuated by the trees growing on both sides of the trail. 
During this part, the GNSS precision drops drastically, hovering around 1.6 m.
From the mark 200 s, the sky view opens and the GNSS achieves its nominal precision again. 
On the other hand, the average precision of the total station reference is 7.0 mm as long as the robot lies in the field of view of the total stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/publications/total-stations/Results_gps_crv_paper.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two experiments show that the proposed total station setup has an equivalent accuracy and precision compared to the RTK solution in an open area. 
However, our solution is significantly better in an obstructed environment such as a forest, where the GNSS signal is weaker because of the vegetation.
Our setup can thus be used as a source of precise ground truth
in both environment.&lt;/p&gt;

Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal, low feature contrast, high illumination variations and
changing environment. This type of off-road environment is an extreme case of situations au-
tonomous cars could encounter in northern regions. Thus, it is important to understand the impact
of this harsh environment on autonomous navigation systems. To this end, we present a field re-
port analyzing teach-and-repeat navigation in a subarctic forest while subject to large variations of
meteorological conditions. First, we describe the system, which relies on point cloud registration
to localize a mobile robot through a boreal forest, while simultaneously building a map. We exper-
imentally evaluate this system in over 18.8 km of autonomous navigation in the teach-and-repeat
mode. Over 14 repeat runs, only four manual interventions were required, three of which were
due to localization failure and another one caused by battery power outage. We show that dense
vegetation perturbs the GNSS signal, rendering it unsuitable for navigation in forest trails. Further-
more, we highlight the increased uncertainty related to localizing using point cloud registration in
forest trails. We demonstrate that it is not snow precipitation, but snow accumulation, that affects
our system’s ability to localize within the environment. Finally, we expose some challenges and
lessons learned from our field campaign to support better experimental work in winter conditions&lt;/p&gt;

We like them rugged bacause they often go outdoors, collecting datasets, capturing lidar maps and driving autonomously around the campus and in the Montmorency forest. The black sheep of this family is the robotic arm, but even that is one day going to end up attached to the Warthog driving in some bushes 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warthog&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Warthog&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;large-all-terrain-unmanned-ground-vehicle-from-clearpath&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Large, all-terrain unmanned ground vehicle from Clearpath&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can handle tough environments with its rugged build, low ground pressure, and traction tires, which allow effortless mobility in soft terrain. In the winter season, we exchange the wheels for tracks that allow it to drive on all sorts of snow. It is the optimal platform for the forest environment the Norlab is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/norlab_robots/warthog_03.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%; float: left; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight: 280 kg + payload (approx. 150 kg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size: 1.52 x 1.38 x 0.83 m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Max speed: 18 km/h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery: 12x lead-acid, 48 V, 2.5 h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard computers: 2x automotive PC, 1x NVidia Xavier planned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensors: 2x 16-beam lidar, 1x 32-beam lidar, IMU, 2x RTK-GPS, 1x RGB camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our research, the warthog is equipped with tree RS-LIDARs from RoboSense, a Dalsa camera for collecting visual datasets, two GPS receivers for reference positioning and an IMU for precise attitude estimation. There are also two onboard PCs, one handling low-level drivers of the motor controllers and one dedicated for high-level tasks such as mapping and navigation. They run Ubuntu with ROS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;husky&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Husky&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;skid-steered-robotic-development-platform-from-clearpath&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Skid-steered robotic development platform from Clearpath&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Husky’s rugged construction and high-torque drivetrain make it suitable for indoor and outdoor, moderately uneven terrains. Husky carries cameras, a LIDAR, and an IMU. It was the Norlab’s workhorse in the DARPA SubT Urban circuit and before that, the first explorer of the Montmorency forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/norlab_robots/husky.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%; float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight: 62 kg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size: 0.99 x 0.67 x 0.39 m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Max speed: 3.6 km/h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery: 2x lead-acid, 24 V, 2 h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard computers: 1x Dell 3070, 1x NVidia Xavier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensors: 1x 16-beam lidar, IMU, 6x RGB camera, 1x RGB-D camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;Its payload has been designed by Norlab's students for the DARPA SubT competition. The ability to explore the environment by an omnidirectional set of high-resolution cameras, by a lidar and by an additional RGB-D sensor makes this platform ideal for developing and testing machine-learning and SLAM algorithms. Although not perfect on obstacles and stairs, it can traverse rough terrain, and thus it is going to serve as a dataset-collecting platform of the lab. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;marmotte-hd2&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Marmotte (HD2)&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;tracked-robotic-development-platform-from-superdroid-robots&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Tracked robotic development platform from SuperDroid Robots&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tracks of this platform are driven by powerful geared motors through heavy-duty chains. Its frame is ribbed and gusseted to make it rigid, and altogether it has a sturdy and solid chassis that will withstand rough treatment. Its size allows it to easily climb obstacles, ascend stairs, and drive over most terrains. In 2021, it is Norlab’s wild card in the DARPA SubT 🔥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/norlab_robots/Marmotte.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%; float: left; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight: 57 kg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size: 1.00 x 0.65 x 0.50 m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Max speed: 4.0 km/h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery: 2x LiFePo4, 25.6 V, 2 h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard computers: 1x Dell 3070, 1x NVidia Xavier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensors: 1x 16-beam lidar, IMU, 6x RGB camera, 1x RGB-D camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;This robot is Husky's young sister (Marmotte is &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt;), equipped with the same sensor suite to accelerate software development for these two robots. Marmotte's advantage is the fact that it can climb stairs and get to places Husky cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vaul-robot&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Vaul robot&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;heavy-unmanned-ground-vehicle-from-superdroid-customized-by-students-to-be-a-snowplow&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Heavy unmanned ground vehicle from SuperDroid, customized by students to be a snowplow&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weight of this robot is perfect to plow snow on the sidewalks. The frame is made from aluminum, and four powerful geared motors allow the robot to carry a heavy payload. Students of the robotic club VAUL made a custom frame to carry the sensors and to protect the motors and batteries from the cold during the winter operations. With its plow, the robot can autonomously push around 40 kg of snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/norlab_robots/vaul.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%; float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight: 160 kg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size: 1.00 x 1.5 x 1.5 m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Max speed: 7.2 km/h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery: 4x Sealed Lead Acid Battery, 2x24V, 2h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboard computers: 1x Dell 3070, 1xNVidia Xavier AGX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sensors: 1x 16-beam lidar, IMU, 3x RGB camera, 2xReach M+ RTK-GPS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;With its diversified sensor suite, this snowplow can operate autonomously in diverse types of weather. The robot participated in its first Autonomous Snowplow Competition in Minneapolis in January 2020.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;universal-robots-ur10e&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;Universal Robots' UR10e&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-ur10e-is-an-extraordinarily-versatile-collaborative-industrial-robot-from-universal-robots&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;The UR10e is an extraordinarily versatile collaborative industrial robot from Universal Robots.&lt;center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our robot is equipped with a Robotiq 2-finger adaptive gripper. With a fixed or mounted-on-the-wrist camera, computer-vision-enabled applications make the UR10e perfect for pick-and-place and bin-picking applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/projects/norlab_robots/Universal_robot_small.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%; float: left; margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach: 1300 mm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payload: 12.5 kg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Footprint: diameter 190 mm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeatability: ±0.05 mm, with payload&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Our end-effector: Robotiq 2-finger adaptive gripper&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;The arm is equipped with 2D and 3D vision systems backed by powerful AI to fully unlock the potential of the robot to use state-of-the-art algorithms for pattern detection and object recognition, and design smart policies for manipulation tasks and autonomous grasping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jana Bartakova</name></author><category term="research" /><category term="project" /><category term="hd2" /><category term="husky" /><category term="robot" /><category term="warthog" /><summary type="html">The list of our robots is growing, see for yourself!

&lt;p&gt;In the last years, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group&quot;&gt;Lie theory&lt;/a&gt; started to gain momentum and proved to be a powerful tool in the domain of state estimation.
The theory was transposed in robotics terms in &lt;a href=&quot;http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/~tdb/&quot;&gt;“State Estimation for Robotics”&lt;/a&gt; by Tim Barfoot. Also, a micro Lie theory was proposed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01537&quot;&gt;Sola et al.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the notations of Tim Barfoot’s book, we designed a cheatsheet synthesizing the main notions to remember when working with Lie groups.&lt;/p&gt;

In general, they require that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The authors disclose the existence of the preprint at submission.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once an article is published, the preprint should link to the published version (typically via DOI or URL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For IEEE, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/post-publication-policies/&quot;&gt;IEEE publication Policies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other publishers, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_publishers_by_preprint_policy&quot;&gt;List of academic publishers by preprint policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;submitting-to-arxiv&quot;&gt;Submitting to arXiv&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Register at &lt;a href=&quot;arxiv.org&quot;&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/arxiv-collector/&quot;&gt;arxiv-collector&lt;/a&gt;:
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; pip &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;arxiv-collector	
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case of problems with the installation, you can download the standalone python file at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/djsutherland/arxiv-collector&quot;&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;.
 You will also need a working installation of latexmk, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/arxiv-collector/#requirements&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; if it is not already installed in your system.
 You can also add the script directly to an &lt;a href=&quot;www.overleaf.com&quot;&gt;Overleaf&lt;/a&gt; project and run it there for the same effect, please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/arxiv-collector/#using-directly-on-overleaf&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Execute arxiv-collector in the root directory of the Latex project:
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; arxiv-collector root.tex
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If using overleaf, arxiv-collector can be used online, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.org/project/arxiv-collector/#using-directly-on-overleaf&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.
 In both cases, an archive &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;arxiv.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt; will be created.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In your &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/user/&quot;&gt;user page&lt;/a&gt;, click on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;START NEW SUBMISSION&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Review the user information and choose a license for your article. Be aware that some publishers may accept preprints on the condition that a specific license is used. In general, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CC BY: Creative Commons Attribution&lt;/code&gt; licence is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Choose a primary classification for the submission. Most of the time, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Computer Science&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Robotics&lt;/code&gt; is a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Next&lt;/code&gt; and upload &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;arxiv.tab.gz&lt;/code&gt; created beforehand. Click &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Continue:Process Files&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the processing went well, you should see a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Preview your paper&lt;/code&gt; button. Click on it and check that the paper did compile properly (pay attention to the figures and equations).
  If the processing yields error, which is quite frequent, see below for some troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On the next page, fill the metadata of the paper. Do not forget to fill the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/code&gt; field with additional information asked from the publisher. You can also specify that the paper has been submitted to the conference/journal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Leave blank most of the last fields (i.e. Report Number, Journal Reference, DOI, ACM class, MSC class). You will be able to update these after the paper is published in the conference/journal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Preview your submission and submit. It should take about a day for the paper to appear on arxiv.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once the paper is on arxiv, an email will be sent to you with a password. Send it to your co-authors so that they can claim ownership of the paper as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not forget that once the paper is accepted in the conference/journal, you need to update the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;field on arXiv with the publisher’s copyright.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;troubleshooting-arxiv-compilation&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting: arXiv Compilation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, the compilation errors come from clashes in packages versions.
An easy solution is to include the packages that may cause errors in the submission so that they are used in the compilation instead of the arXiv server’s packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Locate the package that cause errors in your system by adding the line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\listfiles&lt;/code&gt; in your main latex file, and compile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the log file &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root.log&lt;/code&gt; and search for the packages. You should find lines containing the paths to the packages. For instance:
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; (/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/amsfonts/amsfonts.sty
 Package: amsfonts 2013/01/14 v3.01 Basic AMSFonts support
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Copy the packages in the working directory and execute &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;arxiv-collector root.tex&lt;/code&gt;. The packages are now included in the archive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-upload the archive to arXiv and process the files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;package-biblatex-ieee-error-failed-to-update-citation-style&quot;&gt;Package biblatex-ieee Error: Failed to update citation style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locate and include &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ieee.bbx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ieee.cbx&lt;/code&gt; in the working directory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Johann Laconte</name><email>laconte.johann@gmail.com</email></author><category term="research" /><category term="howto" /><category term="arxiv" /><category term="preprint" /><summary type="html">Before submitting a preprint to arXiv, make sure the publisher permits preprints.

&lt;del&gt;Apply as soon as you can, we are closing the openings soon.&lt;/del&gt;
Here is the list of opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the positions have been filled, but keep an eye on the Norlab website, there will be more in future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;intern-1---not-available-anymore&quot;&gt;Intern 1 - Not available anymore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;computer science, software engineering, computer engineering&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This internship is part of the SNOW (Self-driving Navigation Optimized for Winter) project, which aims at adapting autonomous navigation technologies to environments affected by winter. As part of his mandate, the student will develop an open library to predict the movements of a mobile robot. Several prototype algorithms have been analyzed in a Python Notebook, and must now be coded cleanly to allow real-time computation on a moving robot. The goal of the library is to allow researchers in the laboratory to do experiments faster. Ultimately, these experiments will allow mobile robots to adapt to changes in traction caused by snow cover during autonomous navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trainee will be supervised by a PhD student specializing in control, allowing the student to focus on software development while acquiring practical robotics skills. The student will also be expected to support the team’s efforts in robot integration and field deployments. The intern will have access to state-of-the-art equipment and a 500 kg robot. The library will be publicly hosted on the lab’s GitHub and will be integrated with ROS (Robot Operating System).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For contextual information, see &lt;a href=&quot;../../research/snow/&quot;&gt;the project page on SNOW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;intern-2---not-available-anymore&quot;&gt;Intern 2 - Not available anymore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;computer science, software engineering, computer engineering&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laboratory is continuously developing several 3D mapping solutions for autonomous vehicles. Once the robot is on the move, it is relatively easy to locate it on a map. However, the laboratory has no software tools to relocate a robot if a map is reused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the internship is to develop a software to relocate a robot in a given 3D map. The first step will be to relocalize the robot manually in a 3D graphical user interface (rviz). In a second step, the placement of the robot will have to be refined automatically using a recalibration tool used in the laboratory. Finally, an algorithm to find the optimal placement of the robot in the map automatically (Go-ICP) can be implemented. The student will be supervised by experts in 3D cartography and the registration algorithm. The code will be publicly hosted on the GitHub of the laboratory and will be integrated to ROS (Robot Operating System).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For contextual information, see &lt;a href=&quot;../../research/libpointmatcher/&quot;&gt;the project page on libpointmatcher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;intern-3---not-available-anymore&quot;&gt;Intern 3 - Not available anymore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laboratory is preparing for a major U.S. deployment in September 2021. The goal of this deployment is to explore underground environments using a fleet of autonomous robots. To do so, the laboratory recently acquired new robots and commissioned the design of a custom power supply board for the sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of the internship is to complete the electronic integration of the robots and to participate in the robustness tests of the systems. The tracked robots should be able to climb stairs and withstand a certain level of shock. The student will be supervised by robotics experts with backgrounds in computer science, electricity and mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For contextual information, see &lt;a href=&quot;../../research/darpa-subt-urban/&quot;&gt;the project page on SUBT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;intern-4---not-available-anymore&quot;&gt;Intern 4 - Not available anymore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;computer science, software engineering, computer engineering&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laboratory is preparing for a major U.S. deployment in September 2021. The goal of this deployment is to explore underground environments using a fleet of autonomous robots. The laboratory is developing 3D mapping and localization solutions based on lidars, but the maps used are often too sparse to allow obstacle avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objective of this internship is to combine the data from a lidar with the robot’s localization algorithms to produce a dense map within a close radius of the robot. In a first step, a dense map will be produced and displayed in a graphical user interface (rviz). Then, compression solutions will be tested to reduce the bandwidth of these maps during wireless transmission. Finally, obstacle avoidance algorithms will be studied. The student will be supervised by experts in 3D mapping and resetting algorithms. The code will be publicly hosted on the laboratory’s GitHub and will be integrated to ROS (Robot Operating System).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For contextual information, see &lt;a href=&quot;../../research/darpa-subt-urban/&quot;&gt;the project page on SUBT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;work-environment&quot;&gt;Work environment&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All internships will be held in the Norlab (Northern Robotics Laboratory). This research laboratory specializes in mobile and autonomous systems operating in northern or difficult conditions in general. We aim to study problems related to navigation algorithms in order to push the limits of what is currently possible to do with a mobile robot in real-life conditions. Currently, our efforts are directed towards localization algorithms based on laser sensors (lidar) and 3D reconstruction of environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laboratory has two workshops in the Adrien-Pouliot building allowing interaction with research equipment according to current health standards. Unless otherwise specified, software development can be done remotely using existing data sets. Once the basis has been demonstrated, tests can be done on site with real research robots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;compensation&quot;&gt;Compensation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two possible compensation options. The first option is for students aiming to continue at the Master’s level. If you have a rating greater than 3.8/4.3, we suggest that you apply for the NSERC Fellowship (https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_fra.asp). Obtaining this scholarship will allow you to improve your record as a young researcher and normally comes with supplements from FRQNT. The laboratory also gives a $3,000 scholarship supplement for the internship. The application deadline is February 18, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not selected for the award, salaries are set according to the collective agreement for research assistants and are approximately $15/hour. The work week is 35 hours/week. The duration of the internship may vary from 12 to 15 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;application&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send your choice of internship, your CV and your transcript to the laboratory director, François Pomerleau &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:francois.pomerleau@ift.ulaval.ca&quot;&gt;francois.pomerleau@ift.ulaval.ca&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
